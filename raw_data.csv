"Health Insurance Coverage of the Total Population"
"Notes"
"For more current data using the Current Population Survey, see [Health Insurance Coverage of the Total Population (CPS)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/health-insurance-coverage-of-the-total-population-cps/).  The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by KFF. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates.    The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. See definitions for more detail on coverage type. * The count of people with Medicare excludes those who report having both Medicare and Medicaid coverage, also known as dual eligibles. If these individuals were instead categorized as having Medicare, the total number of people with Medicare would increase as follows:<br>      - 2019: from 45,286,700 to 56,182,200</br><br>      - 2018: from 43,837,300 to 54,685,100</br><br>      - 2017: from 42,802,900 to 53,401,400</br><br>      - 2016: from 41,628,600 to 52,099,100</br><br>      - 2015: from 40,558,200 to 50,747,800</br><br>      - 2014: from 39,364,700 to 49,231,400</br><br>      - 2013: from 37,939,800 to 47,515,000</br><br>      - 2012: from 36,470,400 to 46,081,400</br><br>      - 2011: from 35,074,700 to 44,427,200</br><br>      - 2010: from 34,335,100 to 43,246,000</br><br>      - 2009: from 33,037,500 to 41,876,400</br><br>      - 2008: from 32,115,800 to 39,037,500</br><br> Data may not sum to totals due to rounding.

"Adult Poverty Rate by Gender"
"Notes"
"For more current data using the Current Population Survey, see [Nonelderly Adult Poverty Rate by Sex (CPS)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/nonelderly-adult-poverty-rate-by-sex-cps/).  The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by KFF. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates.   Data may not sum to totals due to rounding. The U.S. Census Bureau's poverty threshold for a family with two adults and one child was $20,578 in 2019. This is the official measurement of poverty used by the Federal Government, and the measure used for most poverty-based data presented on State Health Facts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces simplified - but very similar - versions of these poverty thresholds called ""poverty guidelines"" that are used to assess eligibility for income-based programs such as Medicaid. For more information on measures of poverty, please see the detailed description provided by HHS: [http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm](http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm).
